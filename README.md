## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Liam, and I'm an aspiring Front End Web Developer pursuing my diploma in Digital Media and Information Technology. 


ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Wordpress, along with other services like PHPmyadmin and others to expand my skillset.

 I am excited to expand my skillset and work on more projects that (hopefully), end up here.
